Megan R. Ebers is a postdoctoral scholar in applied mathematics with the [NSF AI Institute in Dynamic Systems](https://dynamicsai.org/) at the University of Washington. Her research focuses on physics-informed machine learning for engineering and scientific discovery. She is an incoming data scientist at PNNL in Seattle, WA researching scientific machine learning.

In her PhD research, she developed and applied machine learning methods for dynamical systems to understand and enable human mobility. During her PhD, she interned with Genentech and used machine learning to inform which drugs have the most potential to succeed in clinical trials. Her postdoctoral research focused on data-driven and reduced-order methods for complex systems, so as to continue her work in human-centered research challenges and extend her research to a broader set of technical challenges, including turbulent flow modeling, natural disaster modeling, and personalized health monitoring. 

She was advised by [Dr. Kat M Steele](https://steelelab.me.uw.edu/) (who combines engineering, medicine, and accessible design to understand and enable human mobility) and [Dr. J Nathan Kutz](https://faculty.washington.edu/kutz/) (who researches numerical methods for modeling complex dynamical systems). She was supported by the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program and the NSF AI Institute in Dynamic Systems.

When she's not neck-deep in code, you'll find her in the mountains hiking, climbing, or snowboarding.
