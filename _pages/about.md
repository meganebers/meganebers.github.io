I am postdoctoral scholar in Applied Mathematics at the University of Washington with the [NSF AI Institute in Dynamic Systems](https://dynamicsai.org/). I'm interested in data-driven and reduced-order modeling of complex systems to extract actionable insight from real-world data. Rather than focusing on just one application domain, Iâ€™m excited about applying my ML expertise to a wide variety of complex problems, such as human movement, pharmacology, electromagnetism, fluids, and climate.

In my PhD, I was advised by [Dr. Kat M Steele](https://steelelab.me.uw.edu/) (Mechanical Engineering) and [Dr. J Nathan Kutz](https://faculty.washington.edu/kutz/) (Applied Mathematics) using machine learning to study human movement. I was supported by the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program and the NSF AI Institute in Dynamic Systems.

When I'm not neck-deep in code, you'll find me in the mountains hiking, climbing, or snowboarding.
