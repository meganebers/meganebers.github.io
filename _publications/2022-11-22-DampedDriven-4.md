excerpt: 'The characterization of the underlying instability has significant implications for engineering design. Specifically, instead of engineering at the level of the complex physical processes, one should instead consider the potential for engineering the overall gain and loss curves.'

Damped-driven systems are ubiquitous in engineering and science. Despite the diversity of phys-
ical processes observed in a broad range of applications, the underlying instabilities observed in
practice have a universal characterization which is determined by the overall gain and loss curves of
a given system. The intersection of the gain and loss curves define an energy balanced solution. By constructing an iterative map between the loss and gain curves, the dynamics can be shown to be homeomorphic to the logistic map, which exhibits a period doubling cascade to chaos.

Irrespective of the physics and its complexities, this simple geometrical description dictates the universal set of logistic map instabilities that arise in complex damped-driven systems. More broadly, damped-driven systems are a class of non-equilibrium pattern forming systems which have a canonical set of instabilities that are manifest in practice.
